```shell
gem install bundler
bundle install
```

This is where you manage which Jekyll version is used to run.
When you want to use a different version, change it below, save the
file and run `bundle install`. Run Jekyll with `bundle exec`, like so:

```shellx
bundle exec jekyll serve --incremental
```

This will help ensure the proper Jekyll version is running.
